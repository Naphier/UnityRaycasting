# UnityRaycasting
Examples in 2D raycasting, layer masks, and bit shifting

This small project is to illustrate varying uses of layer masks. It provides an interactive way to test layer masks and view bit shifting in the inspector. The goal is to provide beginners with a better understanding of layer mask usage when doing raycasts as the subject can be confusing to many.
